<summary><b>Unit 2: WHS Legislation &amp; Risk Management – Advanced Scenario</b></summary>
<article>
<h4>Case Study / Scenario</h4>
<p>A school recently invested in a new metal lathe. Before students used the machine, the instructor failed to review the Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) and supervise the setup. A student selected the wrong speed and did not tighten the chuck properly. The workpiece came loose and flew out of the lathe, narrowly missing classmates. Although no one was hurt, the near‑miss prompted the school to review its responsibilities under WHS legislation.</p>
<p>During another project, students performed a risk assessment for a welding task but skipped documenting control measures, assuming personal protective equipment alone would suffice. Later, fumes accumulated because ventilation was inadequate and one student became dizzy.</p>
