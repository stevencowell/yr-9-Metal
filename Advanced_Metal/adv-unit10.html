<article>
<h4>Case Study / Scenario</h4>
<p>For their final assessment, students were asked to design and build a metal toolbox with drawers. One group rushed into cutting steel without a clear plan or measurements. Parts did not fit, materials were wasted and the project was abandoned. Another student created a detailed design brief, produced cardboard prototypes, developed a materials list and timeline and successfully completed their toolbox on time.</p>
<p>In a different class, students produced a small art sculpture. They spent little time evaluating the finished piece, missing opportunities to improve both aesthetics and function in future projects.</p>
