<summary><b>Unit 6: Joining Techniques – Advanced Scenario</b></summary>
<article>
<h4>Case Study / Scenario</h4>
<p>As part of a garden project, students designed a metal planter requiring watertight joints. They initially proposed using pop rivets for speed but soon realised riveted seams leak. Welding seemed like a better option, but some students worried about distortion and heat marks on thin sheet metal. One student attempted to braze galvanised steel without removing the zinc coating and experienced toxic fumes and poor joint quality.</p>
<p>In another situation, a student used an adhesive intended for plastics to bond two aluminium plates, only to find the joint failed under load.</p>
<h4>Advanced Questions</h4>
