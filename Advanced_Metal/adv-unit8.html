<summary><b>Unit 8: Heat Treatment &amp; Finishing – Advanced Scenario</b></summary>
<article>
<h4>Case Study / Scenario</h4>
<p>To make a set of metal punches, students hardened the steel by heating it to bright red and quenching it in cold water. Most of the punches cracked or shattered when used. In another attempt, a team annealed copper sheet by heating it and then cooling it quickly under running water, only to find that it remained stiff and hard to bend. These experiences raised questions about how heat treatment changes metal properties.</p>
<p>After completing their projects, different finishing methods were chosen: one student painted their metalwork, another used powder coating, and a third left bare steel exposed. The painted finish chipped easily, the powder coating proved durable, and the bare steel rusted within weeks.</p>
