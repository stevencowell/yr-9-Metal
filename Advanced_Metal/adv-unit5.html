<summary><b>Unit 5: Cutting &amp; Shaping Techniques – Advanced Scenario</b></summary>
<article>
<h4>Case Study / Scenario</h4>
<p>Students were tasked with producing curved aluminium brackets. One pair used the guillotine and bending brake correctly and produced clean, consistent bends. Another pair attempted to cut the brackets with a hacksaw and file. Their cuts wandered off line, they wasted material and their brackets were not symmetrical. Later, they tried to use a nibbling machine without adjusting the clearance and jammed the cutter.</p>
<p>In a separate exercise, a student used a power shear to cut sheet metal but failed to keep their hands clear of the blade, narrowly avoiding injury. The incident highlighted the importance of machine set‑up and hand positioning.</p>
