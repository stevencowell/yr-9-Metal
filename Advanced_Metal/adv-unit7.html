<summary><b>Unit 7: Lathe &amp; Machining Operations – Advanced Scenario</b></summary>
<article>
<h4>Case Study / Scenario</h4>
<p>A student was tasked with turning a mild steel rod to a precise diameter on the centre lathe. They selected a high spindle speed and heavy feed rate intended for aluminium. The cutting tool overheated, the surface finish was poor and the workpiece went out of tolerance. Another student omitted the tailstock support when machining a long shaft and experienced chatter and vibration.</p>
<p>During a demonstration of facing and parting operations, one student failed to tighten the toolpost properly, causing the cutting tool to shift mid‑cut. The workpiece and tool were damaged.</p>
