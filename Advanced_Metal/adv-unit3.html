<article>
<h4>Case Study / Scenario</h4>
<p>A community garden asked students to build durable outdoor benches. The team chose mild steel for strength but did not apply a protective finish. After a few months outdoors, the benches began to rust and stain the paving. They realised they had not considered corrosion resistance or alternative materials in their design.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another group fabricated a lightweight toolbox from aluminium. It was easy to carry but dented easily during use. In the workshop, a student quenched a freshly forged steel chisel in water to save time. The chisel later chipped and cracked when used to cut steel.</p>

<ol>
<li><label>Compare ferrous and non‑ferrous metals in the context of outdoor furniture and toolboxes. Which materials would you select for each project and why?<br><textarea name='q1' rows='3' style='width:95%'></textarea></label></li>
<li><label>Describe how heat treatment processes such as annealing, quenching and tempering modify the properties of steel. How could the student have improved the performance of the chisel?<br><textarea name='q2' rows='3' style='width:95%'></textarea></label></li>
<li><label>Suggest suitable protective finishes or coatings for steel used outdoors. What factors influence your choice of finish for a given application?<br><textarea name='q3' rows='3' style='width:95%'></textarea></label></li>
