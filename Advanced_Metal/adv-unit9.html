<summary><b>Unit 9: CNC &amp; Advanced Manufacturing – Advanced Scenario</b></summary>
<article>
<h4>Case Study / Scenario</h4>
<p>Students designed a custom keyring using CAD software and generated toolpaths for a CNC mill. In the first run, they forgot to set the machine’s origin correctly. The tool plunged into the vice and broke. The error prompted a discussion about coordinate systems and machine setup.</p>
<p>Another group used a 3D printer to produce a prototype metal component. They printed it vertically to save space, but the layers separated when the part was tested. The instructor explained how print orientation and support structures affect strength and quality in additive manufacturing.</p>
<h4>Advanced Questions</h4>
<form class="quiz" data-week="Unit 9" id="adv-unit9">
<ol>
<li><label>What advantages do CNC machines offer compared with manual machining? How can careful planning of toolpaths and setup prevent errors like tool collisions?<br><textarea name='q1' rows='3' style='width:95%'></textarea></label></li>
<li><label>Outline the process of converting a CAD model into G‑code for CNC machining. What considerations (such as tool selection, speeds and feeds) must be made?<br><textarea name='q2' rows='3' style='width:95%'></textarea></label></li>
<li><label>Discuss how additive manufacturing (3D printing) complements subtractive methods in metalwork. What design considerations, such as orientation and support, affect print quality and strength?<br><textarea name='q3' rows='3' style='width:95%'></textarea></label></li>
