<summary><b>Unit 1: Workshop Safety &amp; First Aid – Advanced Scenario</b></summary>
<article>
<h4>Case Study / Scenario</h4>
<p>During a metalworking class, a student named Alex decided to bypass the safety guard on a bench grinder to work faster. While grinding a piece of steel, the workpiece caught and was thrown, causing Alex to lose balance and suffer a cut. Another student attempted to help but wasn’t sure how to respond. After the incident, the class reviewed what went wrong.</p>
<p>In a separate session, a student heated metal using a gas forge without wearing appropriate protective equipment. Hot scale popped from the metal and caused a minor burn on their forearm. The teacher used this as an opportunity to reinforce first aid procedures and hazard reporting.</p>
