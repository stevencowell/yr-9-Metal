<summary><b>Unit 4: Marking‑out &amp; Measuring Tools – Advanced Scenario</b></summary>
<article>
<h4>Case Study / Scenario</h4>
<p>During a skills competition, teams were asked to produce a metal bracket with precisely spaced holes. One team relied solely on a steel rule and marker. The result was misaligned holes and an unusable part. Another team used marking‑out dye, a scriber, odd‑leg calipers and a centre punch, followed by drilling. Their bracket fit perfectly.</p>
<p>Later in the course, a student misread the vernier calliper when measuring a shaft’s diameter, resulting in an undersized component that would not fit its mating part. The mistake was not discovered until assembly, causing delays and material waste.</p>
